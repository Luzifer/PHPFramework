# Requirements

Currently the best supported setup (as we use it for development) for this framework is this:

- Debian / Ubuntu Linux (Most recent LTS Ubuntu is running on the dev server.)
- PHP 5.3.0 or greater (I've tested it on 5.2.6 and it works as well)
- Apache 2.2 with PHP running with mod\_php and mod\_rewrite enabled (PHP over CGI is working but buggy)
- MySQL 5.1 (but 5.0 or even 4.x should work as well)

# How to install this framework

1. Get the sources in a [tar.gz file](https://github.com/Luzifer/PHPFramework/tarball/master) 
   or see the [Download](https://github.com/Luzifer/PHPFramework/downloads) section for more
   options.
1. Put it on the server in a directory outside the Document Root to use all security features
   built in.
1. Set the document root to the **/public/** directory
1. If you need it set up a MySQL database and user and put the settings to the **/config/settings.ini**

If you have no chance to run the framework with DocumentRoot set to **/public/** you also can move
all files of **/public/** to the main directory, put this into any subdirectory and modify the 
**.htaccess** file for your needs. I recommend to add one **.htaccess** file to each directory you
don't need to access directly (classes, config, docs, handlers, helpers, lib, templates) with this 
content to get a little bit of security back:

    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all

# Things you should try after installing

1. Look at the configuration at **/config/settings.ini**
1. Define your own URL handler at **/config/urls.php**
1. Write your own handler class and place them to **/handler/**
1. Modify the existing or write your own templates in **/templates/**
1. Place your static resources somewhere in **/public/**
1. Add the directory **/template/cache** with chmod 777 to support template caching

If you have done all of that points I'm pretty sure you got how this
framework is supposed to work. Now you can build nearly everything 
with this. 

You are missing something? Just implement it and send me
a patch file or pull request for your work!
